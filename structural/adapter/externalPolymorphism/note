for adapter consider vector or array and use smart pointer 
move old interface to own file
move new interface to own file
have main in own file

mention can't change old
mention could use vector to be more general, but if know code will have fixed size elements, array is lighter weight as it doesn't have to worry about being resized.

can these be unique ptrs? unique<unique>? there is a delete in the execute class.  It would be nice to get rid of it.
