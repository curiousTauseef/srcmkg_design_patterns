# srcmkg_design_patterns
tweaked design patterns examples (C++) from sourcemaking.com 

(01/07/17 -- Tal
I have just created the site. I will be adding examples as I get around to them.)

[SOURCEMAKING](https://sourcemaking.com/) does a good job on explaing many of the common [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns).  Typically for each design pattern covered, there is a series of examples, covering a number of different languages.  Many of examples in C++ relying on older C++ syntax rather than taking advantage of more modern syntax.

This repo gives my take of what the example would look like using more modern C++.  I don't claim to be an expert on the various design patterns.
